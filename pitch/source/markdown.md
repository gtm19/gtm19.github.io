* Who do I report this to?

???

Who? For water (example) this is determined 100% by your location. You might not know where you are (as I didn't)

--

* How do I report it?

???

How? Google it - but Twitter can be ping pong, phone is too long (I'm doing them a favour), email not practical if I am passing by

--

* What details are needed?

???

What? Depends how I report it - if I email, I have to decide for myself what information is required.

--

* What's in it for me?

???

All of the above probably means I'm just not going to bother.
